### Cookies and Sessions :
Both sessions and cookies are used to store user data on the web, but they have some key differences:

Location:

Sessions: Stored on the server-side. The server creates a unique session ID and stores information associated with that ID.
Cookies: Stored on the client-side, meaning they are small text files saved on the user's browser.
Lifetime:

Sessions: Typically end when the user closes their browser or logs out of the application.
Cookies: Can be set to expire after a specific time period (persistent cookies) or when the browser is closed (session cookies).
Data Size:

Sessions: Can store larger amounts of data, limited by server resources.
Cookies: Have a size limit, typically around 4KB.
Security:

Sessions: Generally considered more secure than cookies because the data is stored on the server and not easily accessible by the user.
Cookies: Can be vulnerable to manipulation or theft if not secured properly.
Use Cases:

Sessions: Used to store user-specific information across multiple pages within a single application, like shopping carts or login status.
Cookies: Used for various purposes, like remembering user preferences (language, theme), tracking website analytics, or personalized advertising.

### uuid and id :
While "UUID" and "ID" both seem like synonyms for unique identifiers, there are key differences between them:

1. Specificity:
ID: integer numbers -> auto increment
UUID: string format

2. Uniqueness Scope:
ID: limited
UUID: As designed, a UUID has an extremely high probability of being unique across all systems and applications, globally.

3. Use Cases:
ID: IDs are used for various purposes like referencing data entries, tracking users, linking items, and more. Their specific use depends on the context and implementation.
UUID: Due to its globally unique nature, UUIDs are especially suited for situations where uniqueness across disparate systems or applications is crucial. Examples include identifying files across platforms, tracking anonymous users, or ensuring unique device identifiers.

4. Readability and Size:
ID: IDs can vary in format and size depending on their method of generation. They can be simple numbers, longer alphanumeric strings, or even user-friendly codes.
UUID: While unique, UUIDs tend to be longer and less human-readable due to their complex format. This can be a drawback for user-facing applications.

5. Security:
ID: The security of an ID depends on its generation method and implementation. Some can be easily guessable or predictable, posing security risks.
UUID: While not inherently secure, the inherent randomness and complexity of UUIDs make them harder to guess or forge, contributing to better security in specific cases.
